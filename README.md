**Functionality**
  For functionality i have implemented encrypt and decrypt and works just like the ClI ask for. And is able to take keys and dates. Also able to decrypt given keys and dates. 3/4  

**Object Oriented Programming**
  I have implemented one module and and my code i chose this because this was a long part of my code and was needed to make it shorter.  4/4

**Ruby Conventions and Mechanics**
  All of my classes were named accordingly there could be some classes that could be named better but i think that would take more space and would be to long to code. Also none of my test are longer then 10 lines. 3.5/4

**Test Driven Development**
  Test coverage is at 100% and i did test all of my test accordingly since this project had many random numbers i think i did my best to get it tested. 3.5/4

**Version Control**
I have 40 commits and 8 pull request. I did commit when i have fixed a major issues or just got farther along in the project. For this reason. 3.5/4
